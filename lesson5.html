                <p>
                    Number Guessing Game – Write a script that will guess the number a 
                    user entered from 1 to 999. Users can only enter whole numbers, but 
                    you need to validate the entry.  If the number entered is valid, 
                    continue with your guesses.  If the input is not valid, inform the 
                    user without making any guess attempts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your script is NOT allowed to evaluate the users input for anything 
                    other than logical comparisons such as greater than, less than or equal to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have a maximum of 10 guesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each guess from your script will result in two lines of output:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            an indication of what number is being guessed
                        </li>
                        <li>an indication of the result of the guess compared to the users 
                            number – guess is greater than the number, guess is less than the 
                            number or guessed the right number
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each set of guess output will be numbered to indicate how many guesses 
                    have been made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you guess the number in 10 or fewer guesses, let the user know you 
                    won.  If you don’t guess the number in 10 guesses, let the user know they won.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Output to the user is to be done using innerHTML so both lines of each 
                    guess output is in their own paragraph.  All guesses are to remain on 
                    the screen at the end of each game – don’t overwrite a previous guess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may use any type of loop structure you would like to control your guesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Write a pseudo code document outlining the processing before designing
                    your JavaScript code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you choose to include CSS in your assignment, it must be in an external CSS file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will submit your HTML file, pseudo-code, and any additional files 
                    in a single zip file. Name your zip file to submit - "yourname-L5.zip."
